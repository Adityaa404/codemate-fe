It aims to streamline the development process by setting up the necessary configurations for a React project within the Vite ecosystem.\n\n## Main Functionalities\n1. **React Setup**: The code sets up a basic React project structure within the Vite build tool.\n2. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Enables the application to update modules without a full reload, allowing for faster development iterations.\n3. **ESLint Rules**: Includes ESLint configurations to enforce code quality and maintain consistency.\n\n## Step-by-Step Functionality\n1. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n2. Start the development server:\n   ```bash\n   npm run dev\n   ```\n3. Write React components in the `src` directory.\n4. View the application in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`.\n5. Make changes to the code and observe HMR in action.\n\n## Handling Specific Inputs\nThe code handles React components, JSX syntax, and Vite configurations. For example, creating a new React component in the `src` directory and importing it into the main `App.jsx` file demonstrates how the code processes specific inputs.\n\n```jsx\n// src/MyComponent.jsx\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return <div>Hello, World!</div>;\n};\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\n## Key Assumptions and Dependencies\n- Assumes basic knowledge of React and JavaScript.\n- Dependencies include React, Vite, and ESLint.\n\n## Limitations and Edge Cases\n- Limited support for complex project structures or advanced configurations.\n- Edge cases may arise when integrating additional libraries or tools not covered in the template.\n\nBy following the provided setup and guidelines, developers can quickly start a React project within the Vite environment, leveraging HMR for efficient development cycles.\n\n---\n\n**For Non-Code Files:**\n\n*Overview*: This template configures a React project to work seamlessly with Vite, providing a fast and modern development experience.\n\n*Important Settings*: \n- ESLint rules can be customized in the `.eslintrc` file.\n- Vite configurations are defined in the `vite.config.js` file.\n\nAvoid extensive code snippets from non-code files to maintain focus on the main code documentation.",

Overall Purpose:**\nThe purpose of this code snippet is to provide a centralized location for storing the URL used to fetch all flights data from an API. By exporting this constant variable, it can be easily accessed and reused throughout the codebase.\n\n**2. Main Functionalities:**\n- Defines a constant variable `GET_ALL_FLIGHTS` with the value of the API endpoint for retrieving all flights data.\n\n**3. Handling Specific Inputs:**\nSince this code snippet only defines a constant variable for the API endpoint, there are no specific inputs to handle. However, in a broader context, the code that uses this constant would typically make an HTTP request to the specified URL to fetch flight data.\n\n**4. Key Assumptions and Dependencies:**\n- Assumes that the API endpoint provided (`https://api.npoint.io/4829d4ab0e96bfab50e7`) is valid and returns the expected data.\n- Dependencies include the availability and proper functioning of the API to retrieve the flight data.\n\n**5. Limitations and Edge Cases:**\n- One limitation is that if the API endpoint changes or becomes unavailable, the code using this constant would need to be updated accordingly.\n- Edge cases to consider include handling potential network errors, timeouts, or unexpected responses when making requests to the API.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- Programming Language: JavaScript\n- Framework or Library Used: None\n- Specific Areas of Focus: Constant variable definition for API endpoint\n\n**Helpful Answer:** This code snippet simply defines a constant variable that stores the URL for fetching all flights data from an API. It serves as a centralized reference point for the API endpoint, making it easier to manage and reuse throughout the codebase. The code assumes the availability and correctness of the API endpoint and may need to be updated if the endpoint changes.

Import the `useWindowDimensions` custom hook.\n2. Define the `useScreen` custom hook.\n3. Call the `useWindowDimensions` hook to get the current window dimensions.\n4. Determine if the screen is considered mobile based on the width being less than or equal to 1080 pixels.\n5. Return an object with a boolean value indicating whether the screen is mobile or not.\n\n**Specific Inputs Handling:**\n\nThe code takes no direct inputs as it relies on the `useWindowDimensions` hook to get the window width. An example of how to use this custom hook would be:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useScreen } from './useScreen';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n    const { isMobile } = useScreen();\n\n    return (\n        <div>\n            {isMobile ? <p>Mobile View</p> : <p>Desktop View</p>}\n        </div>\n    );\n};\n```\n\n**Key Assumptions and Dependencies:**\n\n- The code assumes that the `useWindowDimensions` hook is functioning correctly and providing accurate window dimensions.\n- It depends on the predefined width threshold of 1080 pixels to determine if the screen is mobile.\n\n**Limitations and Edge Cases:**\n\n- One limitation is that the code only checks the screen width to determine if it's mobile, which may not cover all aspects of mobile responsiveness.\n- An edge case to be aware of is when the screen width exactly matches 1080 pixels, as it may not behave as expected in some scenarios.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- This code snippet can be integrated into React components to conditionally render content based on the screen size.\n- Follow the existing coding conventions and style guides of the project when using this code.\n- Recommended testing practices include unit testing the `useScreen` hook to ensure it correctly identifies mobile screens based on the defined threshold.",
